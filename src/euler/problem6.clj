  "The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

  1^2+2^2+...+10^2=385
  The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

  (1+2+...+10)^2=552=3025
  Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025âˆ’385=2640.

  Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.")
